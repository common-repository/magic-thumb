Magic Thumb™ is a fantastic way to enlarge thumbnail images using a JavaScript lightbox effect.

== Description ==

Magic Thumb™ requires two images to work. A large image (approx 450-550 pixels height) and a smaller image which will act as the thumbnail (approx 80-120 pixels height).

The large image appears when the thumbnail is clicked. The image loads instantly due to the lightbox effect.

Features include:

* Automatically fit to screen
* Multiple images with thumbnails
* Always visible close button
* Text positioning to right or left
* Button position in any corner
* Link lightbox image to a URL
* Option to customize each image differently
* API options
* Next/previous/close buttons
* Caption set by the alt or title tag
* Large image downloads after everything else
